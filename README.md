In recent times, there has been a notable shift in the healthcare landscape, particularly in the field of biomedical research, towards the adoption of personalized medicine. This approach tailors medical treatment to individual patients based on their unique characteristics. The objective of this study is to enhance personalized medicine by leveraging omics data and machine learning algorithms, focusing on the identification of subgroups within non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
This research unfolds in four distinct phases. The first phase involves downloading and preprocessing data to create a concatenated file that integrates various data layers, including mRNA, miRNA, methylation, and protein data. In the second phase, preprocessing is applied to the multiomics data, followed by the utilization of an autoencoder model to nonlinearly transform high-dimensional NSCLC data into a lower-dimensional space. The compressed data undergoes consensus k-means clustering (k=5) to reveal distinct clusters.
Moving on to the third phase, subgroup identification is conducted by annotating the top ten genes and proteins within each cluster. The fourth phase incorporates the application of different classifiers, including support vector machine, Random Forest, and feedforward neural network classifiers, to classify the data and determine the optimal classifier.
This code serves the purpose of both dimensionality reduction using autoencoders and classification of clustered data using multiple classifiers.
